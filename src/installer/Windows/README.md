This installer is written so that in general it shouldn't need updating.
However, if it does need updating, you need the NSIS compiler. This can
be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/). You will also need the
INetC plugin, found [here](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in). Copy the
dlls into C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\Plugins.

Install and launch the compiler. Open the installer.nsi file in the compiler, and
compile it. This will create the installer.exe file.
