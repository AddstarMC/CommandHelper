Still to do before localization is complete:

#### Site
- Need to figure out why square bracket links are wrong only when translated.
- Need to translate a few more pages manually to ensure everything is applying correctly.

#### l10n-ui
- Pull Requests aren't implemented.
- Find Segment menu isn't implemented.
- Ensure Help file is complete and correct.

#### Segments
- Learning trail isn't translated at all yet.
- Some <%templates%> that could be translated aren't added to the segments list yet.
