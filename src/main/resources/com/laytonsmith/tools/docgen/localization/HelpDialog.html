		<h3>General</h3>
		<p>
			The MethodScript website supports localization efforts, to better serve communities that are primarily non-English
			speaking. While much of the application itself is necessarily written in English (function names, etc would be a
			disaster to try to localize), the documentation for the application does not necessarily need to be in English.
		</p><p>
			To this end, a Localization (or L10n) framework has been put in place to facilitate bilingual localizers to help
			translate the documentation into languages other than English! Much care has been put into ensuring the accuracy of
			the documentation, and the language of it is no exception. General help for the localization framework can
			be found on the website <a href="%%wiki|Localization%%">here</a>, and you should be familiar with that
			before using this tool, but this help file describes use of the tool itself.

		<h3>Fork Repository</h3>
		<p>
			Before the system can be used, you must fork the primary repository, and create a local copy. Go to
			Tools->Fork Database... to launch the fork tool, which will help you get a repository initially set up.

		<h3>Allowing Machine Translations</h3>
		<p>
			To use the machine translation features of the tool, a subscription to the Azure Cognitive Services
			must be set up. More information about how to sign up for an account and subscription can be found
			<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">here</a>. While paid subscriptions
			exist, there is a free tier, which can be used in limited amounts per month. Once a subscription to
			Cognitive Services is set up, the key and endpoint can be found under Resource Management -> Quick Start. 
			These values can be copied into the tool under Tools->Add Azure Key. You can choose to store the values
			to your computer, so they don't need to be re-entered every time, but do keep in mind that they are stored
			in plain text in your local persistence network, so it may be unwise to do so.
