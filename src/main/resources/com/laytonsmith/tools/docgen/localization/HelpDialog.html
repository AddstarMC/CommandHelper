		<h3>General</h3>
		<p>
			The MethodScript website supports localization efforts, to better serve communities that are primarily non-English
			speaking. While much of the application itself is necessarily written in English (function names, etc would be a
			disaster to try to localize), the documentation for the application does not necessarily need to be in English.
		</p><p>
			To this end, a Localization (or L10n) framework has been put in place to facilitate bilingual localizers to help
			translate the documentation into languages other than English! Much care has been put into ensuring the accuracy of
			the documentation, and the language of it is no exception. General help for the localization framework can
			be found on the website <a href="%%wiki|Localization%%">here</a>, and you should be familiar with that
			before using this tool, but this help file describes use of the tool itself.
