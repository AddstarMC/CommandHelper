.SH NAME
mscript \- Unix frontend for the MethodScript programming language

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mscript
.PP
.B mscript \fB[\fISCRIPT\fB]\fR
.PP
.B mscript \-\- \fB[\fIOPTION\fB]\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fImscript\fP is a frontend for MethodScript, which wraps the native jar, for easier access to
commandline tools, interpreter mode, and script execution.
.TP
All commands listed could be otherwise run from the jar directly, but this offers a more
convenient and unix friendly frontend.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
If invoked without options, the interactive interpreter will be launched. Typing \fB\-\fP
on a line by itself will exit the interpreter, as will the exit() function.
.PP
If invoked with a single argument, this is interpreted as a script, and it the script
at that location will be executed.
.PP
If the first argument is \fB\-\-\fP, then all proceeding arguments are passed as is
to the jar. This will be as if you ran java -jar NameOfJar.jar <arguments>. This
is shorthand for launching the command line tools. For further details on the command
line tools, run \fBmscript \-\- help\fP.
