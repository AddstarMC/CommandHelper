MethodScript provides various methods for connecting to and running SQL commands.
The methods exposed ALWAYS use prepared queries, making your code far less prone
to database injection attacks, as well as better compile time checks where possible.

The SQL framework uses JDBC to connect, so any database backend compatible with
JDBC is supported with MethodScript. You must have an SQL server set up and running
already, which is beyond the scope of this article.

== Configuration ==

To simplify connection information to various databases, MethodScript allows two
ways of connecting to a server. Either via ''profiles'' or via in code connection
information. When connecting statically, connection via profiles is the preferred
solution, since it makes coding easier, and makes it harder to accidentally leak
database credentials when sharing code. To create a profile, create a file in the
<code>profiles</code> directory. The name of the file should be the profile name.
If any directories are in the profiles folder, they are ignored. The profile file
is an ini style file, which should contain the same information that is used during
the connection if you were using the query method that takes a connection object,
however, if the profile doesn't exist at script startup time, it will immediately
cause an error, instead of waiting until runtime. If the connection information
is incorrect, that is a runtime error. Connections to different SQL server types
may require different connection information, so you'll need to see the connection
configuration information for each supported server type.
