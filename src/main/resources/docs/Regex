MethodScript uses Java style regexes, so in general, any regex guides you find online for Java will apply to 
MethodScript as well, with the obvious caveat that the actual functions used in Java will vary. Regex is a non-trivial 
subject, and entire websites have been dedicated to it, so it is not in the scope of this wiki to cover it. For further 
reading, [http://www.regular-expressions.info/ see this website]. A "test harness" script is also provided with the 
[[CommandLineTools#examples|installable Local Packages]]. The package to install is 
"RegexTestHarness".
