This page is intended for developers of the backend MethodScript engine, not
for assistance with writing scripts in MethodScript. Before beginning development
with MethodScript, you should have a firm grasp of Java, including concepts
like inheritance, abstraction, reflection, annotations, generics, etc. Additionally,
you should have a firm grasp of how the language itself works, from the scripting
perspective.

== Abstraction ==

In general, the compiler works under the assumption that the end runtime is unknown. When compilation
is initialized, only a few key functions are strictly required to be "core" functions. That is,
they MUST have the same implementation in all implementations. Once the Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) is created in memory, it is then linked to a particular platform, which can then
be either used as an in-memory binary, or can be cross compiled to something else.

The commonality between all implementations of MethodScript is limited to the
core functions including procedure related functions, exception related functions,
control flow related functions, basic logic and operator functions, object creation
related functions, and data handling functions. All implementations must accept
that the compiler will use the default implementation of all these functions during
compilation, for static code analysis. Most of these functions are deeply integrated
with the compiler anyways, and cannot be generically separated from the compilation
process regardless. 

== Compilation ==
There are 3 distinct stages during compilation. Lexing, Compiling, and Optimizing/Linking.

=== Lexing ===
Lexing is a standard process that converts the source code into a token stream. This
process follows fairly standard algorithms, and uses a generic mechanism to add new
tokens easily. This mechanism could potentially be dynamically expanded per platform,
should the need arise.

=== Compiling ===
Compilation converts the token stream into a Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This step
can emit only a few errors, (mostly mismatched parenthesis/braces) because the 
lexer will have already halted if the syntax is wrong, and the optimizer is what 
actually causes linking errors. The compiler is a typical recursive decent parser,
only it offloads the complexity of the infix notation parsing to the __autoconcat__
function, which runs separately later, during optimization.

=== Optimizing/Linking === 

Once initial code compilation has occurred, linking happens. Since
the linking process happens after control structures have been analysed, this allows
for "meta programming" using existing control structures familiar to the coder.
In addition to the ${} compiler directive statements, this allows for meta programming
to be accomplished much in the same way C++ provides #define, #ifdef, and other
preprocessor directives, but there is no way for the user to go beyond the intended
cases of simple function substitution, for instance, conditionally #ifdefing out
a closing bracket. This is because this substitution occurs AFTER the lexer runs, not
before it, as happens in C++.

Optimization of the core functions occurs before linking, so actually this step
can be thought of as optimization/linking/optimization. By optimizing the core
functions however, we generally only ''remove'' code from the AST. Some data
transformations do occur, but most of the core functions do not "run" at that time.
Once the initial optimization happens, we link to the actual runtime requested,
by passing control to the individual functions that are linked to that particular
runtime. In combination with the environment, the platform is able to perform whatever
actions it needs to complete the process with the generic compiler, while still
custom tailoring the output to suit that particular platform.

Individual functions have the opportunity to optimize themselves, either by running during
compile time (should they have the ability to) and therefore completely removing themselves
from the AST, or by simply emitting warnings/errors for whatever conditions they can
check for.

== Adding a function ==
Adding a function is simple. Create a new class that implements 
%%GET_SIMPLE_CLASS|.*|Function%%, (or more probably extends %%GET_SIMPLE_CLASS|.*|AbstractFunction%%
and tag it with @api. It is important to read and be very familiar with the methods
in %%GET_SIMPLE_CLASS|.*|Function%%, so you know which methods that are optional should
be overridden.

=== Documentation and argument builder ===
Each function has embedded java doc and type information. This is extremely important
to keep accurate, both for the sake of the user, and for a technical need. The docs()
method should return the plain text user readable documentation, which summarizes the 
behavior of the function. This information isn't used programmatically in any way by
the compiler, but it is used of course by the users, and should accurately reflect
the behavior of the function. Previously, the docs() method needed to return a string
in the format <code>returnType {argumentList} documentation</code>, however, this is
no longer necessary, since the return type and argument list are used programmatically
elsewhere, and therefore specified in different methods.

The returnType() method should return an %%GET_SIMPLE_CLASS|.*arguments|Argument%%, using
the "nameless" constructor of the Argument class. This simply provides the documentation
and return type of the function, no "name" is needed. There is a pre-constructed Argument.VOID
object that should be used in the case where the function returns void. Additionally, there
are a few low level functions that cause execution to terminate in a non standard way, for instance,
the die() method, or return(). These must use the Argument.NONE member, and should also likely
provide the %%GET_SIMPLE_CLASS|.*Optimizable|OptimizationOption%%.TERMINAL optimization.

The arguments() method returns the function's signature. For some functions, this will be quite
complex, for others, it should be straightforward. By design, no arguments are passed to this
method, because all arguments (and their defaults) should be constant, and should never vary
based on runtime parameters. (This complicates the design, but more importantly prevents 
certain optimizations from occurring.) Functions may have multiple signatures, that is,
completely conflicting signature types, though this behavior is only provided for backwards
compatibility, and should not be used for new functions. Disjoint types are recommended instead,
or general simplification of the function instead. See the methods in the 
%%GET_SIMPLE_CLASS|.*arguments|Argument%% class for more information on the various
options available when creating arguments, and %%GET_SIMPLE_CLASS|.*|ArgumentBuilder%%
for information about the ArgumentBuilder as a whole.

== Adding an event ==
Adding an event is only slightly more complicated than adding a function, though
the addition of platform specific abstraction layers may complicate the process
some, both for events and functions. In general, adding an event only requires
two steps, though in practice it may require additions in several places. The first
step is to provide the event object via implementing %%GET_SIMPLE_CLASS|.*|Event%%
(or extending %%GET_SIMPLE_CLASS|.*|AbstractEvent%%) and tagging it with @api. The
second step is to actually hook into whatever system there is for actually triggering
the events, and calling %%GET_SIMPLE_CLASS|.*|EventUtils%% TriggerListener method, with
the event name and event driver, and the actual event object that it will process.
This method will then find all the user bound events, and decide if they actually
need to be triggered, then call the appropriate methods in the Event object.

The factors that can further complicate this are the fact that you will likely be using
abstract event handlers for all of the actual event objects, and that some events
are not as straightforward to modify. These pain points will hopefully be corrected
in the future.
