The examples you see in all the function's detail pages are generated automatically, 
in many cases. This ensures that the documentation and how the code ''actually'' 
works virtually always be consistent, if not working as originally intended.

Examples sometimes aren't really possible to show in text, and so in some cases, 
output is "faked", but you can tell, because code that is automatically generated

<pre style='background-color: #BDC7E9'>will have this color background,</pre>

and code that has "faked" output

<pre>will have this color background.</pre>

While examples will always be "correct" compared to the results you will actually 
see in your code, the handwritten documentation is the de facto standard, and if 
there is an inconsistency between the generated output, and the desired output, 
the handwritten documentation indicates the designed behavior, and it the actual 
implementation will be considered a bug, subject to change as soon as it is fixed. 
In other words, don't rely on the behavior of a bugged example, but you can at 
least use that as a way to be aware of possible issues.
