Installation
------------

This plugin requires Hey0's server modification.

  1. Create a "plugins" folder inside your "bin" folder.

  2. Copy CommandHelper.jar into "plugins".

  3. Add "CommandHelper" to the "plugins" line of your server.properties file.
     If it's not already there, add the line. The line should look like this:
  
         plugins=CommandHelper
     
     If you have multiple plugins, separate plugin names with commas.
     
     *** IMPORTANT: *** CommandHelper must be at the BEGINNING of that list
     if you have other plugins installed.
