3.1.0:
- Added several new functions, including eval, set_ploc, time, nano_time, break, 
continue, get_worlds, pworld, pinfo, and kick. Also, reorganized the source code,
and made it so that if one command would cause a compiler error, the entire script
won't be affected, but just the one command. Also, concatenation automatically
happens now, the g() function is no longer necessary. Debug mode now outputs what
real command is being run, if debug mode is on. It is now possible to define
the location of your config file, in the preferences.txt file.

3.0.2:
- Added new functions to allow scripts to interact with the environment around
    the player.

3.0.1:
- Added several new functions, including a foreach loop, and the g function.
