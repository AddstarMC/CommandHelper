To help standardize the code formatting, please follow these guidelines for code
formatting.

For the most part, the standard Java code conventions should be followed. They can be found at
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html
There are a few exceptions and clarifications however:

* Line Length
Avoid lines longer than 80 characters. When wrapping lines, follow these conventions:

	* Break after a comma
	* Break before an operator
	* Indent to the current level + 2 tabs on the following lines, if the code
	  directly beneath it is on a different indention level
	* If breaking in the middle of a  long string, the space should start the newline. 
		String s = "This is a long string, which has a"
					+ " break in the middle";

* Indentions
Use tabs for indentions, NOT spaces. This allows for tab length to be set by the client,
and also allows for quicker backspacing if deleting indentation.

* Brace style
Braces should be on the same line as the statement.
	if(condition) {
		...
	}
	NOT
	if(condition)
	{
		...
	}

This condenses the file size, and makes more code fit onscreen at once. Since the
code inside of the block should be indented anyways, there is no readability issue
as far as determining what code is actually inside the block or not.

All braceable statements MUST use braces, and newlines.
	if(condition) {
		code;
	}
	NOT
	if(condition) code;
	USUALLY NOT
	if(condition){ code; }

if you have a series of several if statements that only have one statement, and
it makes sense to have them all lined up, the third example may be used, but is
still discouraged. Regardless, the statements must ALWAYS have braces.

* Commits
If you have more than 2 commits, please rebase.
